## Homework submission READ CAREFULLY
### Question 1:
Upload your solution to this as a PDF file. There are many software out there that can be used to create this ER in a digital format. Please rename [GWnetID_University_ER_solution.pdf](GWnetID_University_ER_solution.pdf) using your own GWnetID and then overwrite the file with your own PDF.

### Question 2:
This question uses the GRADEBOOK relational database schema.
The two files [gradebook_schema.sql](gradebook_schema.sql) and [gradebook_insert.sql](gradebook_insert.sql) can be used to create and populate your own databases.

The answers to the SQL questions are going to be graded on **correctness of your queries** AND **MySQL syntax**. Queries that don't compile are not going to be considered. To facilitate checking the syntax you are going to write your queries in the [GWnetID_MySQL_hw_SQL_solution.sql](GWnetID_MySQL_hw_SQL_solution.sql) (rename this with your own GWnetID).

When we run them there should be no error messages
```
source GWnetID_MySQL_hw_solution.sql
```
